> 
> **Scenario Designation:** ΩK-Class
> 
> **Likelihood:** Near Impossible
> 
> **Severity:** Survivable, but requires moderate restructuring of human civilization
> 
> **Description:** An ΩK-Class ("End-of-Death") Scenario refers to a situation wherein immortality is forced upon all life, without any other biological change (for example, the halting of aging or forced sterilization). All protocols regarding this scenario assume steps are taken to avoid any Broken Masquerade situation. This scenario also assumes that the Foundation has maintained its current structure and subdivisions.
> 
> **Priorities:**
> 
> 1\. _Population Control:_ Due to insect population birth and death rate, this must be addressed within twenty-four hours of scenario onset before the insect population overtakes WK-Class Scenario thresholds. After this juncture, it will be imperative that a long-term solution is devised for other organisms.
> 
> 2\. _Veil Control:_ While the entire human population will become exposed to anomalies at this time, it is important that no other anomalies come to their attention. Normalcy will be redefined to account for the effects of the ΩK-Class Scenario, and containment must be continued. A misinformation campaign is to disseminate a cover story that explains the newfound immortality in terms of fabricated research.
> 
> 3\. _Research Terminal State Replacement:_ If true death is not achievable, an alternative must be engineered for ethical reasons. It has been deemed unacceptable to let mankind suffer indefinitely due to decaying biological components.
