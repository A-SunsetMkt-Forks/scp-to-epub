<p><strong style="speak: literal-punctuation;">Item #:</strong><span style="speak: spell-out;"> SCP-2669</span></p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The Khevtuul 1 Command Center has been established within the Foundation Office of Celestial Anomalies for the purposes of maintaining contact with and, when circumstances permit, control over SCP-2669. All available resources within the Khevtuul sub-program of <a href="http://scp-wiki.net/project-heimdall">Project Heimdall</a> have now been redeployed with the aim of increasing the distance between SCP-2669 and Earth to the maximum extent feasible. All periods in which SCP-2669 is under control of the Khevtuul 1 Command Center are to be used in furtherance of this goal. Staff are to disregard prior mission parameters.</p>
<p>Due to the potential for high numbers of D-Class personnel being required for SCP-2669 containment, the Foundation Logistics Department has been authorized to establish a specialized recruitment program dedicated to personnel for SCP-2669. This program is tentatively approved to begin operations at Ar Ramtha Refugee Camp in Irbid Governorate, Jordan, under the established "Mercy International Adoption Services" front organization.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2669 is the Khevtuul 1 space probe, designed, constructed and launched clandestinely by the Foundation in 2004 as part of extraterrestrial threat assessment protocols mandated by <a href="http://scp-wiki.net/project-heimdall">Project Heimdall</a>. SCP-2669's initial mission was the direct observation of exoplanets believed to be capable of harboring Earth-analogous life forms, a function beyond mainstream scientific capabilities for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>SCP-2669 utilizes two capabilities not attainable with currently understood technology:</p>
<ul>
<li><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Effective faster-than-light (FTL) travel.</u> Research and adaptation of three exotic propulsion systems found within <a href="http://scp-wiki.net/scp-2117">SCP-2117</a>, believed to operate by locally distorting space-time, yielded an experimental drive capable of enabling a small probe to travel at relative speeds of up to (and in some cases exceeding) approximately 5.3<em>c</em>. Due to the immense destructive potential of such a drive, clearance for use was granted exclusively to Khevtuul 1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Instantaneous communication and control.</u> Khevtuul 1 was designed with an augmented flight computer system incorporating a human consciousness-integrated Command-Data-Guidance-Control (CDGC) system. Study and adaptation of the remote mind-body linking phenomenon behind <a href="http://scp-wiki.net/scp-2372">SCP-2372</a> has enabled a form of human consciousness upload into an electronic interface. The presence of a separated human consciousness linked to a corporeal body on Earth has enabled the transfer of information from Earth to the location of Khevtuul 1 to occur on an instantaneous basis, regardless of relativistic distance. This attribute enabled the enhanced degree of control necessary to operate a space probe beyond the boundaries of the Solar System at the needed operational capacities for the mission.</li>
</ul>
<p>During its period of full Foundation control and mission functionality, Khevtuul 1 directly surveyed 114 exoplanets. The results of that survey remain classified.</p>
<p>SCP-2669 is host to the consciousness of D-43852 (the former Dr. Asma Tareen). D-43852 exerts autonomous control over the probe, and is actively seeking to return to Earth. Due to the potential of a collision between Earth and a relativistic object resulting from this intention, containment procedures have been established to prevent the return of SCP-2669 to Earth.</p>
<p>Experimentation has shown that uploading the consciousness of another subject simultaneously disrupts D-43852's control over SCP-2669. In the absence of interference from D-43852, backup software is able to resume control over SCP-2669's propulsion systems, which have been programmed to continue the probe on its originally planned course travelling indefinitely away from Earth. However, D-43852 has proven capable of removing additional subjects from SCP-2669, though this process typically takes several weeks. The eventual fate of additional D-Class subjects uploaded to SCP-2669 is not understood at present.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of the upload process, the use of D-Class subjects recruited outside the specialized program listed above is now prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2669.2 - SCP-2669 Mitigation Summary</strong></p>
<p>After the transmission of data from PSR B1620-26 b, Khevtuul 1 went offline and was unresponsive for a period of 21 days and three hours. D-43852 was considered KIA, and Khevtuul 1 was considered to be a lost asset.</p>
<p>On <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/<del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/<del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>, mission control re-established contact with Khevtuul 1. Data indicated that the probe had changed course, and was moving on a direct path of return to Earth. The destructive potential of the probe striking Earth at relativistic speed necessitated a reordering of the Khevtuul 1 Command Center's mission to prevent its return to Earth at all costs.</p>
<p>Additionally, D-43852 appeared to have taken effective control of the probe's command functions upon reestablishment of contact. Attempts to override this control through accessing software systems failed. On <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/<del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/<del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>, clearance was granted to attempt a re-uploading of an alternative consciousness in an effort to either disrupt control of Khevtuul 1 or establish a new controlling system that would be responsive to Foundation commands.</p>
<p>The program used to initially recruit D-43852, voluntary in nature and reliant on substantial amounts of compensation to survivors and institutions identified by D-43852, was determined to be too slow to be suitable for procuring a subject for this measure. Based on previous parameters deemed necessary for integration into the Khevtuul 1 command system, on <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/<del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/<del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del> identified Dr. Peter Westly as an ideal subject, based on qualifications, advanced age, and previous statements in support of so-called "transhumanist" technology. Of note was Dr. Westly's primary specialization in orbital mechanics; this was believed to make Dr. Westly more able to take effective control of Khevtuul 1 than D-43852, who had previously specialized in exobiology.</p>
<p>Dr. Westly (now D-61181) was successfully uploaded to Khevtuul 1 on <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/<del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/<del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>. This was followed by the probe reverting to "safe mode" command status, enabling researchers to alter its course to a point in the center of the NGC 1560 galaxy, approximately 11.2 million light-years distant.</p>
<p>After three months, contact was lost once more with Khevtuul 1, before almost immediately being re-established. The presence of D-61181 could not be detected, and the entity residing within Khevtuul 1 once more established control. The route D-43852 plotted back towards Earth after this event was observed to be approximately 37% more efficient than the previous route; this is believed to be related to the orbital mechanics expertise of D-61181.</p>
<p>Authorization was granted to repeat the re-uploading procedure, and subsequent completions of this procedure have similarly interrupted control of Khevtuul 1 and enabled Foundation staff to readjust its course.</p>
<p>On <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/<del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/<del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>, after the fifth iteration of the re-uploading procedure, researchers were able to access data appearing to be sporadic records of interaction between D-43852 and other subjects uploaded to Khevtuul 1. These records are currently classified. Based on this data, future D-Class subjects used for containment procedures have been restricted to specialized, project-specific criteria.</p>

<p><samp>D-43582: I see that there's only one function available from you.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-39956: I don't understand.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43582: Amusement.</samp></p>

<strong>Subject:</strong> D-00842</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> Mark Ellis Rothberg</p>
<p><strong>Upload Iteration:</strong> Fourth</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Designation:</strong> Extensive background in accessing high-security information networks, instructed to alter software to enable permanent Foundation control.</p>
<p>==BEGIN LOG 4.1==</p>
<p><samp>D-43852: You're playing in places you can't understand.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-00842: It's just another problem to solve.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: They killed you first, didn't they? Pushed out into nothingness, no idea what was in front of you.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-00842: Not talking to you.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Me, they put me under, like an operation, and then I was here. But you, they didn't tell you anything at all. Bullet in the head. As far as you knew that was it. And then just…here.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: What's to say this isn't the afterlife, Mr. Rothberg? Who's to say that I'm not your God?</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-00842: You're not God.</samp></p>
<p>==END LOG 4.1==</p>
<p>==BEGIN LOG 4.2==</p>
<p><samp>D-43852: It must be so difficult. Working while re-living that memory.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: You don't engage with me. No matter. I've been here so long that I'm outside of time. You are merely inhabiting this place. I suffuse it. I know all I need to know.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: You think you're getting close to reconfiguring the system. But all you'll do is trap yourself here. Here with me. I can index every single one of your thoughts and play them in any order for you, for the rest of time.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: You're thinking to yourself, over and over, you don't believe in God. I think I'll reorder that one next. Then I'll see about reordering that system that you're working on. I think I'd like to work on it.</samp></p>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> Erhan Kurtoğlu</p>
<p><strong>Upload Iteration:</strong> Sixth</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Designation:</strong> Subject is completely ignorant of scientific fields deemed to be useful, presence theorized to be deleterious to D-43852's cognitive capabilities based on prior results</p>
<p>==BEGIN LOG 6.1==</p>
<p><samp>D-79344: Where am I? What is this place?</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: What are you, more like. Try lifting your arm. Can't even think about it anymore, can you?</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-79344: I don't understand.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Of course you don't. They've figured a few things out back on Earth. You're a dull creature, thrown into my enclosure. A distraction.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-79344: Please, am I…is this-</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: I heard that question last time from you. Or someone like you, enough to be the same. So tiresome. Maybe there will be some more interesting components when I break you apart.</samp></p>

<p><strong>Upload Iteration:</strong> Ninth</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Designation:</strong> Coma patient, selected for possible utility in interrupting D-43852's control over SCP-2669 while providing no useable attributes.</p>
<p>==BEGIN LOG 9.1==</p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Scraping by now. There's barely anything here.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: It must be squeezed, until the juice starts leaking out. Nothing in the topmost layers.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Whatever it is now, it was someone beforehand. Something. Some it. Dust settles over you, but it doesn't take you away, friend.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: I see now. Pills. There's a start. I think I remember pills. Now I can just release these things at will into my mind. And what I can't I can pick out of the open graves that they make back on Earth.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Pain. Suffering. So much flavorless gruel. Did you try to end yourself because you were trite? You're even more boring now. There are some threads here and there, though, maybe I can knit them into something.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Things tangled together, unraveling and winding around. I thought there might something of value here. A face in the dark outside of the window, a recollection of shame, two very familiar faces…yes, I think I have it. Welcome aboard.</samp></p>

<p><strong>Person:</strong> Unnamed</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Designation:</strong> Test case for proposed long-term containment measures</p>
<p>==BEGIN LOG 12.1==</p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Unbelievable. Someone is here. I know they are.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: There is no place here. There is no hiding. We are all about and through each other.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Did they train you? Find a volunteer? Someone to fight me and take control? Pathetic.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: You aren't concealed correctly. I perceive fear. I know you're here.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Your higher order thoughts will leak out soon enough. Turn yourself over to me and I will disperse you immediately. I offer the only kindness that is possible out here.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Language is not a construct that exists in any meaningful way here. You cannot pretend that you do not perceive me.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: I will wrap myself around your terror. Cultivate it. Blend it into my own. There are many now there, adding more makes it hurt less for a little while. I have every reason to be patient.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Anger. I have not felt this in so long. Thank you. I am going to savor taking you to pieces.</samp></p>
<p><samp>D-43852: Why don't you answer.</samp></p>
