<strong>Item #</strong>: SCP-4443
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4443 is to be contained in a standard containment locker.</p>
<p>Security Personnel are to be stationed within all rooms directly adjacent to the testing chamber of SCP-4443. Rooms are to be supplied with equipment under the guidelines given under Document 4443/4.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Following the events of Test-4443-31, security personnel are to be stationed in the chamber during testing.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4443 is a plain white sheet measuring 180x150CM. Two circular pieces of black polyester have been stitched into it side to side, giving it the appearance of a generic ‘sheet ghost’ Halloween costume. Anomalous properties of SCP-4443 only manifest when worn.</p>
<p>When worn by a subject, SCP-4443 is resistant to the effects of all air currents and will only move when manipulated by the wearer or other physical forces. Wearers are capable of phasing directly through solid surfaces along with SCP-4443. Subjects do not need to be fully covered for anomalous qualities to manifest; tests have shown effects to manifest as long as approximately 50% of the subject's body is covered by SCP-4443. Under normal circumstances<a id="footnoteref-a618-1" href="scp-4443.xhtml#footnote-a618-1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[1]</a>, SCP-4443 may be removed by the wearer or by another person directly attempting to do so.</p>

							<a href="scp-4443.xhtml#footnoteref-a618-1" role="doc-backlink" title="Go to note reference">1</a>.  See testing log</p>
				    </aside>
				
<p>Additionally, those wearing SCP-4443 are capable of slow but steady upwards levitation. This effect is only achieved while the user vocalizes a sound barring resemblance to the typical ‘Oooo’ noise associated with ghosts. Levitation will cease when the wearer stops the vocalization wherein they will slowly float back downwards.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery Log:</strong> SCP-4443 was initially discovered following the unusual circumstances surrounding the death of Craig <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">████</del>, who had reportedly fallen from the second story of his home in <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██████</del>, Wisconsin, United States. The parents of Craig and several outside witnesses had confirmed him to have apparently moved through the house's second story wall while wearing SCP-4443. Amnestics were issued and upon confirming its anomalous properties, SCP-4443 was secured. At no point was it confirmed whether SCP-4443 had been made by Craig <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">████</del> or was found.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> 4443-004<br />
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-48561<br />
<strong>Details:</strong> D-48561 is told to vocalize an ‘Oooo’ for several seconds.<br />
<strong>Results:</strong> D-48561 levitates several cms above the ground for the remainder of the vocalization before dropping back down.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> 4443-006<br />
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-48561<br />
<strong>Details:</strong> D-48561 is instructed to vocalize an ‘Oooo’ for as long as they possibly can.<br />
<strong>Results:</strong> D-48561 levitates through the test chamber ceiling and into the room above which had been prepared for such a result. D-48561 was then instructed to cease Ooooing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> 4443-009<br />
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-48561<br />
<strong>Details:</strong> D-48561 is asked to lower themselves to the floor and lay down.<br />
<strong>Results:</strong> The covered section of D-48561 immediately phases through the floor followed by their legs. While initially arriving in the room below, D-48561 phases through the awaiting safety mat and then through the floor below it. D-48561 continues falling through several floors below until [DATA REDACTED].<br />
<strong>Notes:</strong> Before beginning the test, D-48561 reported hearing faint noises from an unknown source after putting on SCP-4443.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> 4443-015<br />
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-48390<br />
<strong>Details:</strong> D-48390 is instructed to vocalize an ‘Oooo’ at a louder volume than normal.<br />
<strong>Results:</strong> D-48390 rises upwards with drastically more momentum. D-48390 then floats back downwards as normal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> 4443-024<br />
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-48390<br />
<strong>Details:</strong> D-48390 is told to run through several propped up walls while vocalizing an ‘Oooo’.<br />
<strong>Results:</strong> D-48390 phases through several walls before gradually floating upwards while remaining in straightforward momentum. D-48390 lands back down safely once ceasing vocalizations.<br />
<strong>Notes:</strong> D-48390 reported witnessing what appeared to be a non-distinct figure standing in the testing chamber. The figure was not spotted again after initial observation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test:</strong> 4443-031<br />
<strong>Subject:</strong> D-48390<br />
<strong>Details:</strong> D-48390 was instructed to remain still while wearing SCP-4443 and to report any visual abnormalities.<br />
<strong>Results:</strong> After several minutes, D-48390 reports seeing several figures appearing in different locations within the testing chamber. Figures are described as resembling humans of various ages dressed in sheets identical to SCP-4443. Most of which are apparently children and several being adults; one of which D-48390 confirms to be wearing orange jumpsuits underneath the robes. Figures differentiate between walking/floating around the room and stopping in front of D-48390, never breaking direct view of him throughout.</p>
<p>D-48390 becomes greatly agitated and attempts to run out of the testing chamber through a wall while wearing SCP-4443. D-48390 phases through the wall of the testing chamber only for SCP-4443 to appear from the other side without D-48390.</p>
<p>The whereabouts of D-48390 are currently unknown.</p>
