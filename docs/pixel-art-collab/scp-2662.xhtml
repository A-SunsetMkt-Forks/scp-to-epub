<p><strong style="speak: literal-punctuation;">Item #:</strong><span style="speak: spell-out;"> SCP-2662</span></p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <del style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</del> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Containment of SCP-2662 is primarily focused on preventing unauthorized entry into its containment unit. For this purpose, on-site Task Force Tau-9 ("Belligerent Bodyguards") has been organized to guard SCP-2662's containment unit and keep track of new religious followings focusing on the worship of SCP-2662. Task Force Tau-9 is <del style="text-decoration: line-through;">to use non-lethal methods when dealing with an attempt of unauthorized entry</del> authorized to use lethal force if necessary. All members of Task Force Tau-9 are to be tested bi-annually for cognitohazardous influence.</p>
<p>As containment of SCP-2662 is completely voluntary, it is currently contained in an enlarged humanoid containment unit with standard safety measures for low-risk humanoids as detailed in Document 0998-KA. Additionally, SCP-2662 is allowed one copy of a daily newspaper of its choice, a computer and requested computer games totaling no more than 50 US dollars every month.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2662 is a cognitohazardous entity approximately 4 meters in height and 200 kilograms in weight. SCP-2662 appears to be in a vaguely humanoid shape, with approximately 20 additional muscular hydrostats in similar structure to cephalopod limbs attached to its back. These limbs are fully functional and allow SCP-2662 to perform up to 10 different tasks at once.</p>
<p>SCP-2662's primary anomalous effect only occurs after long-term repeated exposure, usually by being in the same room as or interacting daily with SCP-2662. Subjects exposed to SCP-2662 for a period of 6 months or longer are at risk of becoming acutely aware of SCP-2662's wants or needs and are compelled to fulfill them; they may also suffer from quasi-psychotic episodes when under stress. SCP-2662 is unable to affect humans that have a 2 or higher MARS (Mind-Affecting Resistance Scale) score.<a id="footnoteref-e66b-1" href="scp-2662.xhtml#footnote-e66b-1" role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref">[1]</a></p>
				    <aside id="footnote-e66b-1" role="doc-footnote" epub:type="footnote" class="inline-footnote">
						<p>
							<a href="scp-2662.xhtml#footnoteref-e66b-1" role="doc-backlink" title="Go to note reference">1</a>.  SCP-2662 can only affect approximately 5 percent of the human population and 2 percent of Foundation personnel. It is therefore considered a low-risk cognitohazard.</p>
				    </aside>
				
<p>SCP-2662's secondary anomalous effect is the spontaneous generation of religious followings at an approximate rate of at least once a month. This generation is involuntary and causes SCP-2662 notable distress.</p>
<p>Religious groups generated by SCP-2662 usually focus on attempting to break into its containment unit in order to perform various rituals that are violent and/or sexual in nature. These groups tend to be highly organized and appear to adapt to each failed attempt, despite there being generally no contact between different generated religious followings.</p>
<p>Below is an incomplete log of incidents relating to SCP-2662. A full list can be found in Document 2662-I.</p>
<p><strong>Incident 2662-07:</strong> On <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/<del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>/2003, a religious group known as "Towards Hymn" successfully broke into SCP-2662's containment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;22:50&gt;</strong> SCP-2662 is seen taking a shower in preparation for sleep. There is a loud noise as previously undiscovered explosives are detonated underneath the center of SCP-2662's containment unit.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;22:51&gt;</strong> Five injured civilians climb out of the hole left by the detonation. SCP-2662 leaves the shower to investigate the noise.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;22:52&gt;</strong> Agents <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">███</del> and <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">█████</del> notify Task Force Tau-9 of a breach into containment. They attempt to suppress the initial five civilians unsuccessfully as five more arrive with weapons.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;22:56&gt;</strong> After a brief struggle, Agents <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">███</del> and <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">█████</del> are pinned down and tied with rope by the civilians. The injured civilians approach SCP-2662. The uninjured civilians stab their hands with knives, masturbate, and then draw unknown symbols on the walls with a mixture of sexual fluids and blood.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;22:58&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-2662: "Aw man, come on. That's really not sanitary. Or necessary."</em> SCP-2662 appears to gag upon witnessing the symbols. The injured civilians successfully corner SCP-2662 in the shower stall.　</p>
<p><strong>&lt;22:59&gt;</strong> The injured civilians are seen squeezing blood out of their wounds and rubbing it onto SCP-2662 while singing. <em>SCP-2662: "Jesus Christ! Stop! Please! I just took a shower!"</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;23:00&gt;</strong> Task Force Tau-9 arrive to SCP-2662's containment unit. Task Force Tau-9 manage to suppress all civilians successfully and proceed to move SCP-2662 to a temporary unit until repairs can be completed.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;8:24&gt;</strong> Security officers stationed at SCP-2662's containment unit enter with a researcher. The researcher can be seen carrying a piglet.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;8:25&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-2662: "Can I help you?"</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;8:26&gt;</strong> <em>Researcher <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">████</del>: "Oh our lord, please accept this innocent suckling swine, freshly orphaned from slaughter of both mother and father!

<p><strong>&lt;8:28&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-2662:"Uhm… No thanks. I'm full. Go home. Your, uh, lord is pleased with the offering."</em> Task Force Tau-9 is notified of a breach into containment.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;8:29&gt;</strong> SCP-2662 attempts to read its newspaper. Researcher <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">████</del> slits the piglet's neck and throws it onto the table. Blood splatters the newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;8:30&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-2662: "I- what? Look, can you go read a bible or something? You really, really need it."</em> SCP-2662 puts the newspaper down.

<p><strong>&lt;4:07&gt;</strong> SCP-2662 can be seen sleeping in its bed.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:10&gt;</strong> The entirety of Task Force Tau-9 is called for an off-site mission. Against orders, Task Force Tau-9 chooses to leave 4 of its members behind to keep watch on SCP-2662.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:15&gt;</strong> 2 of the remaining members tackle and lock the other 2 in an unused containment unit.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:20&gt;</strong> A cargo truck arrives on Site <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del> where SCP-2662 is being kept.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:25&gt;</strong> The 2 remaining members unload the cargo of D-class personnel. They lead the D-class personnel to Task Force Tau-9's armory.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:30&gt;</strong> The D-class and the remaining members arm themselves from the armory and break into SCP-2662's containment unit.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:31&gt;</strong> SCP-2662 is roused. Several D-class personnel guard the exit to the containment unit as well as the corresponding hallway. <em>SCP-2662: "Hu- wha? Are we moving? I'm not scheduled until next week."</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:35&gt;</strong> Agents <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">████</del> and <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██████</del>, the 2 remaining available members of Task Force Tau-9, begin undressing the D-class personnel that are not guarding.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:36&gt;</strong> SCP-2662 attempts to alert Task Force Tau-9 to no response.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:37&gt;</strong> Agents <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">████</del> and <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██████</del> begin carving symbols into the buttocks and thighs of the undressed D-class personnel. The D-class personnel begin to engage in group sex after being carved.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:39&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-2662: "What the fuck? Seriously? Now? Look, seriously, can you go find another god? I hear Buddhism is all the rag-"</em> D-class 99304 attempts to pull SCP-2662 into the group. <em>SCP-2662: "The fuck! Stop! Seriously! Lord commands you and all that stuff to cut this shit out!"</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:40&gt;</strong> All D-class personnel currently engaged in sex cease their movements. They all turn to stare at SCP-2662. Task Force Tau-9 arrive at the off-site meeting point only to be told no-such mission exists. Task Force Tau-9 begin moving back to Site <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">██</del>.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:41&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-2662:"Oh thank god, I can control you guys now, kinda. Maturity's happening right on time. Good to know. Ok, tell me what the fuck is going on here."</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:42&gt;</strong> <em>Agent <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">████</del>:"After the bloodbirthing ritual, we're going to take you to your sacred chambers where we, our families, and our lineage will remain in service to you for all eternity.

<p><strong>&lt;4:45&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-2662:"You must be kidding. I can leave whenever I want, I just have to ask. Besides, I-"</em> The D-class personnel begin to continue engaging in group sex. <em>SCP-2662: "Seriously! Stop! You're all fucking disgusting! I'm not even ready to settle down with a cult yet! I'm only, like, two hundred years old! I'm barely legal!"</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:46&gt;</strong> <em>Agent <del class="redacted" aria-label="REDACTED">████</del>:"Do you really think the Foundation will let you go if you ask? Well, you can certainly ask. You'll be sorely disappointed, my lord."</em></p>
<p><strong>&lt;4:48&gt;</strong> <em>SCP-2662:"Yeah, well, if it turns out to be the case, I can just wait until I'm strong enough to break out.
