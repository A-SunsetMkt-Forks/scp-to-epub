<blockquote>
<p>You find the access tunnel, hidden within a natural cave a mile off the main road.</p>
<p>You don't need the keycard. The door is ajar.</p>
<p>It smells here. It smells like <em>them</em>. Hopefully, they've moved on. You've come so far already. You can't turn back now.</p>
<p>There is a slick trail that leads from the cave entrance and into the depths of the site. If it's blood or shit - or something that smeared off one of those <em>things</em>, you cannot tell. You make a point to avoid it.</p>
<p>You're still receiving the distress signal. It only started broadcasting yesterday. Whoever it is - you pray they're still alive.</p>
<p>Your footsteps echo throughout empty corridors. Each footfall sounds for all the world like a dozen, as if you're not treading through the dark alone.</p>
<p>Elevator is down - so you take the stairs, ending on floor B5: Keter Holding. You pass several empty containment chambers. The horrors they once held are long gone.</p>
<p>If you're lucky.</p>
<p>The trail takes you to an office branching off the main hall - the source of the signal. The door is cracked open, but stuck. You plant your feet, push with all your might.</p>
<p>Something skitters out of one of the rooms to your left and around the corner before you can get a good look at it. Your first thought is 'dog'.</p>
<p>It was on the ceiling, though.</p>
<p>You take refuge in the room, slam the door behind you. It's dark here. You're safe. You take off your jacket and head wrap. It'd be a damn shame to die from something like hyperthermia after all that's happened.</p>
<p>The sole operating emergency light rotates in its casing - casting a pale orange glow across the room every other second.</p>
<p>As if the room itself had a pulse.</p>
<p>There's shelving haphazardly placed behind the door - a barricade. You scan the room. Soiled clothes, half eaten food. Despite the presence of an adjoining restroom, there is excrement in a bucket in the corner. A pneumatic chamber on the Northern wall would have been delivering consumables to the occupant.</p>
<p>The trail terminates in the corner of the room, forming a sick puddle. You spot three pharmacy bottles - further inspection reveals them to be various opioids. They're all empty.</p>
<p>There's a desk with a computer atop it. Approaching the terminal, you can clearly see the blinking light of the power button.</p>
<p>You take a seat. Turn it on.</p>

<p>Survivors attempting to travel outdoors must fully cover their bodies in protective clothing; preferably several layers. Travel by foot should be limited as much as possible. Cities - and man-made structures in general - provide the greatest protection. Formerly-wooded areas should be circumvented. Travel by air is preferable above all other methods.</p>
<p>Personnel exposed to SCP-001 are to be considered lost. Compromised personnel are to be abandoned. Euthanization is not to be attempted.</p>
<p>Collective instances of SCP-001-A that are of formidable size are to be avoided at all costs. Conductive electrical weapons have proven partially effective at immobilizing instances, and may be used for self-defense. Incendiary weapons work as well. Cryonic munitions are the most effective thus far.</p>
<p>Testing has revealed that SCP-001-A is relatively safe to consume. This is only to be considered as a last resort in the absence of other options. As SCP-001-A may reconstitute within the digestive system, only small portions should be consumed at a time to prevent blockage.</p>
<p>Personnel stationed at Site-19 are to pursue research concerning off-world colonization. Shuttles must be constructed as to not allow light to penetrate the interior.</p>

<strong>Description:</strong> SCP-001 is the designation given to the Sun, after an event on <samp>[SYSTEM ERROR]</samp> <span style="font-size:smaller;"><em>Data lost: ec172. Contact SysAdmin.</em></span> resulting in ~6.8 billion casualties within the first twenty-four hours. The SCP-001 effect does not seem to result from exposure to ultraviolet rays, but rather light in the visual spectrum (~390 to 700 nm). The effect is similarly present in moonlight.
<p>Upon contact with visible light produced by the sun, living organisms liquefy at the point of contact, with the effect spreading until the entire organism is converted. Visually, this is reminiscent of melting wax. The time this takes is largely dependent on the level of exposure and size of the organism. Despite this restructuring, at no point do living organisms perish.</p>
<p>Upon completion these organisms (SCP-001-A) take on a gelatinous consistency. Motile organisms will attempt to orient themselves in a fashion reminiscent of their previous form, to varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Flora typically remain physically inert, yet are still capable of photosynthesis, and still produce oxygen. Organisms capable of flight lose the capability to do so. Fauna remain sentient, and display behavior that parallels their non-anomalous counterparts when not absorbed into a collective instance. Humans retain a modicum of sapience and memory.</p>
<p>Biological anomalies exposed to SCP-001 are affected in the same manner. It seems that exposure nullifies any previously expressed anomalous characteristics.</p>
<p>Due to their composition, instances of SCP-001-A that make contact with one another may combine and blend at the molecular level. This does not seem to cause any pain or distress to the instances, though the resulting bulk can inhibit movement. Since the SCP-001 event, most instances have congregated into such collectives, which seem to possess no maximum volume.</p>
<p>The resulting biomass is amorphous and chaotic. The component organisms will shift between a full-to-semi-liquid state - limbs and bodies will rise periodically from within the mass for a short duration, before deteriorating and being subsumed by another life-form.</p>
<p>Collective instances will locomote by using their appendages in tandem to carry their mass. Larger instances will form a pseudopod from their constituent life-forms, and drag themselves about in a manner similar to amoeba.</p>

<td>They've just been sitting out there this entire time, calling out to us, begging for us to come outside. The noise drew in more of them. There's this one mass that I'm sure must have a few dozen people and god-knows how many animals roiling around inside it. Screams and bleats and screeches and howls nonstop. Louder than all hell. The worst ones make this disgusting moaning - like they're actually enjoying it.<br />
<br />
They're not going to leave so long as they know we're down here.<br />
<br />
We managed to talk one of the D's into going out - see if he couldn't draw them away. He was surprisingly okay with the plan - all he asked for was a gun, and a single round. He made it out there and one got a hold of him, tried to get his mask off. He managed to work the pistol up beneath his chin in time, got it off. I figured he was lucky.<br />
<br />
After he fell limp though, it kept working at his suit. Pried off the hood, poured itself inside. Began tearing it off of him from within.<br />
<br />
He came back; started changing - dripping out of the suit and screaming and screaming and screaming.<br />
<br />
They won't even let us die.<br />
<br />
The Director has a plan. There's an escape tunnel hidden in his office. Tram under the Site will take us to a safe house - we should be able to start towards 19 from there.</td>

<p>There's a video file attached. Opening it, you see that it presents the room you're in. The feed seems to be coming from one of the security cameras, up in the corner of the room. It's dark, but you can just make out Dr. Igotta - laying on a pile of laundry along the far wall.</p>
<p>She's writhing in her sleep. She seems tormented. Hurt. She's tossing and turning and mumbling nonsense-words.</p>
<p>The camera shakes. It lifts upwards for a moment, before it focuses on her again.</p>
<p>It starts moving closer. Slowly.</p>
<p>The speakers come to life; picking up an airy, breathy static. As the camera moves closer to the doctor, it becomes clearer, crisper. It's not merely white noise, but dozens - hundreds of voices whispering unintelligibly over each other.</p>
<p>You lean in, press your ear almost against the speaker, trying to discern what it is that's being said. Something strange stands out amidst the discordance:</p>

<p>You're not quite sure what to make of it, though. Looking back at the monitor, the camera has come to a halt inches away from the sleeping doctor.</p>
<p>The voices stop.</p>
<p>There is no sound.</p>
<p>A hand. Black and oily and skeletal, reaches out for her, brushes away a lock of hair.</p>
<p>Her eyes shoot open, she recoils in shock. The feed cuts out.</p>

What appears to be the mostly-skeletal remains of a finger is embedded into the flesh of her left hand - in the stump that would have supported her natural ring finger. Two wedding bands loosely encircle the digit, laying atop one another.</p>

<p>Without your prompting, the page begins playing a video file. You freeze when the image loads.</p>
<p>It's a live feed, looking down on you from behind. About a foot away.</p>
<p>A skeletal, inky left hand enters the frame, approaching you at a snail's pace. It's missing its ring finger.<br />
<br />
Without a second thought, you turn and fire in a frenzy. Hoping to drive off the specter.</p>
<p>Your bullets meet an empty wall. There's nothing there.</p>
<p>A second passes before you hear it - before you hear <em>them.</em> Sloshing, wet thuds coming down the corridor, accompanied by a chorus of screams.</p>
<p>It slams into the door. Could there be a place to hide?</p>
<p>It strikes a second time. What appears to be a face - part human, part<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">...</span> <em>something</em> - dribbles in under the frame. Bits of flesh from god-knows-what oozes in through the sides and reconstitutes into fingers, eyes, feathers.</p>
<p>A third. Now it's pressing up against the wood, causing it to sag inwards.</p>
<p>With a groan and a crash, the wood splinters. The door explodes open.</p>
<p>Hands and arms stretch out of the mass, pulling you up, passing you from one to the next, on and on down the line. They drag you past the empty containment units, upwards and through the stairwell, through the halls and towards the tunnel.</p>
<p>You're afforded a few, precious moments in the darkness.</p>
<p>And at the end of the tunnel, there is light.</p>
